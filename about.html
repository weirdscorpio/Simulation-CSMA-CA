                  CSMA is a basic method that controls the communication of
                  multiple participants on a shared and decentralized
                  transmission medium. CSMA/CA is mainly used in wireless
                  networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Components of CMSA/CA include:<br /><br />

                  1)Carrier sense (CA): The initial idea is that participants
                  may only send data over the network if the transmission medium
                  is free. The carrier status detection checks the channel any
                  time, and data is not sent until it’s available.<br /><br />

                  2)Multiple access (MA): Several stations share a transmission
                  medium. It is crucial for functioning communication that all
                  of them adhere to a binding protocol.<br /><br />

                  3)Collision avoidance (CA): A complex schedule tries to ensure
                  that two or more participants do not start a transmission at
                  the same time to avoid collisions. If overlapping does occur,
                  this will be detected and the transmission will be tried
                  again.<br /><br />
                </p>
                <p>
                  The most important rule, which you’ll know from communication
                  situations when there are several participants is only one
                  person may send their information at once. Else, "collisions"
                  of data packets is said to occur.<br />
                  CSMA/CA tries to reduce the frequency of these collisions and
                  provide a plan at the same time on how to proceed if a
                  collision does occur.

                  The basic idea behind CSMA/CA is the “Listen Before Talk”
                  (LBT) principle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Within CSMA/CA, the distributed coordination function (DCF)
                  controls the time a station waits before initiating
                  transmission in a free medium. DCF also assigns certain time
                  slots to network participants for further actions, creating a
                  binding time structure. This procedure is the focus of
                  collision avoidance: a complex time structure that makes it
                  possible to avoid collisions. DCF takes various intervals into
                  account when creating the time structure. DCF interframe space
                  (DIFS): In the first step, participants must monitor the
                  network for the duration of the DIFS to determine whether it’s
                  currently free. For CSMA/CA, this means that no other station
                  within range is sending out a transmission at the same time.
                  The DIFS results from the SIFS almost double the slot time,
                  which is between 28 and 50 µs long. Contention window: If
                  participants determine that the channel is free, they wait a
                  random amount of time before they start sending. This duration
                  corresponds to the contention window. This time window doubles
                  with each collision and corresponds to the binary exponential
                  backoff (BEB) that is familiar from CSMA/CD. Short interframe
                  space (SIFS): After sending the data packet, the recipient
                  node sends a notification – if the RTS/CTS procedure is also
                  utilized. However, this station also waits for a fixed time
                  before sending. SIFS is the time it takes to process a data
                  package. The duration depends on the IEEE-802.11 standard and
                  is between 10 µs and 16 µs.

                <p>
                  The frames “Request to Send” (RTS) and “Clear to Send” (CTS)
                  are part of the optional extension CSMA/CA RTS/CTS. This
                  procedure is upstream of the actual data transmission. If a
                  participant determines that the transmission medium is free,
                  the device first sends an RTS frame to the participant that is
                  to receive the data. With this, the output computer makes it
                  clear that it wants to start a transmission and will occupy
                  the transmission medium for a certain time.
